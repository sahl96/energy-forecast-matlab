# Using MATLAB to mathematically model renewable energy generation. 

This project attempts to create a simulation model for renewable energy generation in a remote area with a population of 6,500.

The renewable energy technologies investigated in this paper are solar panels, wind turbines, and biomass.

This model focuses on power density, energy supply vs. demand, and energy storage over a duration of 24 hours.

Mathematical models were used were obtained from literature reviews and the values for different variables were based on spec sheets of reliable manufacturers.

Specification sheet of the solar panel can be found here: https://www.evoenergy.co.uk/downloads/Sunpower-E20-327W.pdf

Estimation of irradiance for solar power generation was obtained from this paper: I. Richardson, M. Thomson, D. Infield, and C. Clifford, “Domestic electricity use: A high-resolution energy demand model,” Energy and buildings, vol. 42, no. 10, pp. 1878–1887, 2010.
